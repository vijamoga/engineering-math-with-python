Â¡Hola!
This repo has a triple purpose. Two are for my own (re) learning of both my old mathematic courses when I studied Industrial Engineering and to improve the little I know of Python by programming useful stuff related to the math subjects. The third one is to share it with you.

# -----------------------------
# scope
# -----------------------------
My initial aim is to re-study all math related subjects I did back in college (this will take some time), and, at the same time, idle around with Python to regain practice and knowledge of it.
Yes, I am aware that there are several available packages that do most of the stuff I plan to implement (s.a. NumPy), and I will make use of them sometimes.
The subject list looks as follows (this is the order I plan to follow):
* Linear Algebra
* Calculus
* Analytic Geometry
* Complex Calculus
* Optimization and linear programmint
* Ordinary Differential Equations
* Partial Differential Equations
* Numerical Methods for Differential Equations
* Computer Methods for Differential Equations
If I recall correctly that's all.
I will probably include also the three subjects devoted to Statistics and Probability (Basic Statistics, Statistical Methods and Advanced Statistical Methods).
Also, my Master's Thesis was about using Evolutionary Algorithms for solving multi-objective optimization problems, so, it is likely that (whenever I reach this point) I will undergo that area as well.

I make no promises, but this is going to be a living time-consuming project that I will take on my spare time. Patience has always been a good adviser.

# what is going to be here?
# -----------------------------
Mostly the code I program with some basic in-code hints on what is it about, as well as an updated documentation for the package.
For any academic stuff related to the subject, a side-goal for this learning project is to convert my hand-made notes into digital files, this will be available in a website that I opened to write about my many concers (mostly on Science and Philosophy), that is also a long-time project I am doing in my spare time.

It is written in Spanish (my mother tongue) and whatever I produce in terms of academic notes shall also be in Spanish. Once I finish the scope above (if I ever do so...) I will take care of translating it into English. But don't worry, anything of relevance for the code in here will be in proper English with links to websites that give a glimpse or further explanation on the topic.

That's all,
Cheers,
